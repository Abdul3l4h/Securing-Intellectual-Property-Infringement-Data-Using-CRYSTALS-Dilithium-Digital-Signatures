#Intellectual Property Overview
Intellectual property is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, such as literary or artistic works and symbols, that are owned through a company or individual. The four main types of intellectual property rights include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Owners of intellectual property use these IP laws to protect their intangible assets and prevent others from illegally obtaining their creation. Although these laws are employed to secure intellectual property, technology is constantly evolving and enabling bad actors to gain unauthorized access to, distribute, forge, and tamper with intellectual property.
